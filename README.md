# **US-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis-Project**
# **Overview:**
In this project, we will make use of python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
- According to the input the code will import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
- The Source code takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


# **What Software Do I Need?**
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


### **The Datasets:**
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year


# **Statistics Computed**
After the user has chosen which city he wants to discover either Chicago, New York City, or Washington. In this project, the code will provide the following information:
* 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day

* 2 Popular stations and trip
  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

* Trip duration
  - total travel time
  - average travel time

* User info
  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
